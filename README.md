# Scrimba - Hometown Homepage

Hello! This is a landing page I was tasked to create as part of the HTML&CSS Scrimba course.

Once again, I feel like I didn't nail the CSS just right, but some progress was made.

(Berlin isn't really my hometown, but I wanted an excuse to make it about Berlin, since I plan to learn German and move there.)
